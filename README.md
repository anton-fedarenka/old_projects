# Portfolio

The attached files contain examples of my work in the field of date science. 
These are mainly not complete models, but rather their fragments and problem solving examples that demonstrate my ability to use various methods and techniques for data processing and analyzing.

- [ad_regression.ipynb](ad_regression.ipynb) - building a regression model for sales prediction and ad optimization
- [churn.ipynb](churn.ipynb) - binary classification (churn)
- [homecredit.ipynb](homecredit.ipynb) - NLP task using word embedding
- [online_game_clustering.ipynb](online_game_clustering.ipynb) - K-means clusterization of the real online game data (not the open source data)
- [quora_mult.ipynb](quora_mult.ipynb) - another NLP task with utilization of multiprocessing tool
